This application serves as a method of visualizing precipitation records stored for a series of weather stations, starting in 1948.

Base file:
  Contains ~3,200,000 data points, representing 63 years worth of data.
  
Aggregation:
  Data is aggregated for each station id at the yearly and monthly level.
  Running aggregator.py will produce two csv files reflecting the 
  yearly (~9000 records) and monthly (~105000 records) data.

  Each output file contains the following columns:
    station_id: integer representing station id
    rained_days: total number of days with rain in time frame
    total_days: total number of days in time frame (i.e. 365 for a year)
    precipitation: list of precipitations values, per day for time frame (i.e. [.01, .0, 032, ....])
    total_precipitation: sum of precipitation values for time frame 
    percent_rained: percentage of days with rain in timeframe
    avg_precipitation: average value for precipitation over time frame
  
  In addition to these columns, yearly output will include a 'year' identifier, monthly will contain both 'year' and 'month'

Data storage:
  Data is currently stored between two Google Fusion Tables:
    yearly: http://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?dsrcid=992163
    monthly: http://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?dsrcid=997507

Web Interface:

  Contains three primary views, each exposing a number of attributes of the data set:
  single/multi/all stations
  daily/monthly/yearly data
